# First thoughts of the HTC Vive

Well today is the day: I've finally received my HTC Vive VR system in the mail. This really is an amazing device. I'm blown away at how far VR since the days of the Oculus Rift DK1\. 

The setup was pretty easy, lucky I didn't have to mount the base stations on my walls as I was able to just place them on the counter. It is recommended for the stations to above head height but I haven't noticed any issues with tracking.
